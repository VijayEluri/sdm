Introduction
============

This project is meant as starting point for Trifork projects that use Gradle 
as build-system.

Add this repository as a remote in git and pull from it. That way you can also
easily get any future additions.

Take a look in 'build.gradle', 'settings.gradle' and in the config-directory
to customize the build to fit your project.

There are two example sub-projects, one Java and one Scala.

Suggestions and patches (or pull requests) are very welcome. If you encounter
any bugs please make an issue on Github.

Git Hooks

version of Scala.
